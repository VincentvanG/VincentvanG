<h2>About me</h2>
<b>Driven by a deep belief in equality of opportunity and a strong aversion towards injustice and inequality, I am proud to be managing Open Cultural Center Barcelona (OCC), an NGO working towards inclusion of migrant communities through educational and cultural activities. Within OCC, I also manage MigraCode Barcelona, our tech academy for refugees and migrants.</b>
</br></br>
With a background in social work, data analysis, nonprofit management, political science and philosophy, my focus has always been on combating structural inequities and bringing people together to make a positive social impact in society.
</br></br>
During my career, I have worked for a wide variety of organizations (nonprofit & for-profit) in the Netherlands, South Africa, Suriname, Greece and Spain. My academic background has its foundation at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (Social Work) and at Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona (Political Philosophy and Communication Science).
